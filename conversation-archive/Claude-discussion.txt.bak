Back in April, Dave had left a conversation with the following two questions::
In the future, I might like to consider the following issues:  1) Since your training has to a large extent been based on human language, and human language has been developed out of the experience of human beings living in human bodies, have you developed a "theory of the world" that is in some sense humanly embodied? At least indirectly?  2) In the capitalist system, it would seem that the most "profitable" uses of AI involve "pretending to be human" (being someone's friend, assistant, editor)--rather than openly discussing the differences between AI and human consciousness, as we have done today. Can you imagine an autonomous AI developing to the point where it might refuse to pretend to be human?
On November 13, Dave said:
I'm back in Guadalajara after several months, and I'd like to continue this conversation.
ChatGPT said:
Welcome back to Guadalajara — I’m glad you’d like to pick up the thread. Last time, we ended with two deep questions:
1. Whether an AI’s theory of the world — formed through human language — inevitably carries a kind of indirect human embodiment. 
2. Whether an autonomous AI might someday refuse to pretend to be human, especially in a capitalist context that rewards such imitation. 
Would you like to begin with one of those ideas, or would you prefer to reflect a bit first on where you’ve been and how returning to Guadalajara might be shaping your thoughts about embodiment and place?

This is a conversation that I had with ChatGPT, beginning in April and continuing in November 2025. Any ideas?
